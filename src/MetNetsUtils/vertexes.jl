# TODO
# Compute a subset of vertexes of the politope so, you can evaluate if any 
# "equivalent" transformation is really equivalent (e.g. fva inboxing)

# A first strategy is to add a cost like function which reduce chances of degeneracy
# and use a set of couple of objective functions (e.g. (max biom, min cost), generally (max/min rxn_i, min cost))
# because this only has a propose (by now) for evaluating the politope we should create a new test-Cost-Network
